Reading articles
================

Run lord in background:

    lord &

or better

    setsid lord

or whatever...

Instruct your favourite newsreader to talk to localhost (or where you
run lord), port 5119.

Run lorpull (e.g. periodically via cron) with proper options, e.g.:

    lorpull                                # all last 10 days articles
    lorpull lor.forum.talks -d 100         # last 100 days articles from Talks
    lorpull '*slack*,*gentoo*' -d 1 -e -1  # last day Slackware and Gentoo
                                           # related articles; do not expire
                                           # old articles


Posting articles
================

Anonymous posting is not currently supported, so you need to have a LOR
account.

Create your user directory:

    mkdir ~/.lornews/users/vasya

Write your password to the password file:

    echo secret > ~/.lornews/users/vasya/passwd
    chmod 600 ~/.lornews/users/vasya/passwd

Now you can post from your newsreader - topic-start articles as well as
comments.

Posted messages must have the following standard headers:

    Newsgroups      - exactly 1 newsgroup name from ~/.lornews/groups
    From            - name in this header is your nick
    Subject         - message title

Useful headers for topic-start articles:

    Keywords        - tags
    X-Link-URL      - URL for a news proof-link
    X-Link-Text     - description of a news proof-link
    X-Image-Path    - path to a local screenshot file
